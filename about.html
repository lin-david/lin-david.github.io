<p>Born and raised in central New Jersey (<a href="https://www.nj.com/politics/2019/12/does-central-jersey-exist-gov-murphy-just-settled-the-argument.html" style="text-decoration:underline;">yes, that exists!</a>), I'm an east-coaster at heart but a west coast transplant for the past several years. I like to learn about new innovations in science and technology and chat about housing (we need more), transportation (I don't like cars), and news. I also love exploring new places and food! &#128523</p>

<p>I work in the tech industry as a software engineer. Being a software engineer is a pretty big privilege, so it's important to stay grounded and self-motivated. I like to help people, and I try to do that through the tremendous opportunity that technology offers.</p>

<p class="mb-5">In other parts of my life, I wrote legislative referrals to the Berkeley City Council. I've also conducted research on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for autonomous vehicles. I've enjoyed being a part of student newsrooms as the Online Manager for the Daily Californian and a writer/editor for my high school newspaper, The Sting. If you go further back, I even authored a research paper on biodegradable, flame-retardant polymer blends (try saying that five times fast). Take a look at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmlin" style="text-decoration:underline;">my LinkedIn</a> for the full picture!</p>
